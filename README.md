This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Development can be run locally by:

1. Running npm start in the spotify-api-marvify directory
2. Running node server.js in the auth-server directory (spotify-api-marvify/client/auth-server; will not be seen here in this repository)

User must have the spotify application opened up on their computer and must be a premium user; PUT methods (Playing the playlist and turning off shuffle) do not work for non-premium users
